There is an incredible new tool out there, called [Scholar Maps](https://scholar-inbox.com/scholar-maps). It's from the people behind [Scholar Inbox](https://scholar-inbox.com/), a trainable individualized recommender algorithm, that supplies you with daily digests of new arxiv papers.

**Membership Inference Attacks From First Principles,** where they propose the Likelihood-Ratio Attack (LiRA) by Carlini et al. is the center of the LiRA research topic

Let's say we look up the paper from Nicholas Carlini et al. about [*Membership Inference Attacks From First Principles*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833649/)*.* We find it's the center of a topic called *LiRA*, short for Likelihood-Ratio Attack, which is the attack they invented in this paper! Nice!

We see the *LiRA t*opic surrounded by other kinds of attacks, such as Label-Only Membership Inference Attacks. Since *LiRA* relies on the log-probabilities of the correct class, it needs more than the label. Seems correct.

LiRA and other attacks, such as Model Inversion Attacks, are in the **Machine Learning Security s**ubfield.

The *LiRA t*opic is part of the *Machine Learning Security s*ubfield. We see another topic a bit further away, such as the Model Inversion Attack.

We see which subfields are close to each other. Machine Learning, Security and Privacy offer various intersections.

Going out a bit further, we see the neighboring subfields: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning and various seemingly synonymous wordings. Secure Computation seems pretty close, given it's a cryptography topic applicable to many use cases. Even from this distance, we see some highlight papers: Label-only membership inference attacks, PATE, PATE-GAN, GAN.

Machine Learning Security is part of the Data Privacy field.

Leaving the subfields behind us, we see the larger picture of research fields: Machine Learning Security is part of the Data Privacy field. And it's close to other fields such as Software Engineering or Education.

Privacy research is closest to **sociology**.

It thinks we are part of the Academic domain of *sociology*. Fair enough, I guess, since privacy and security are societal issues that we aim to solve.

In this projection, economics is between mathematics and sociology.

We are further away from our mathematics friends than it feels. But electrical engineering is quite close. Maybe it makes sense that so many people who studied EE switch to machine learning, like myself?

But yeah, looking at this it makes sense that if you take computer science and go further into the direction of philosophy and sociology, you might end up with data privacy. Cool!

The universe of human knowledge. LiRA is at the very edge of the universe, I guess.

And there you go. The universe of human knowledge (that exists on arxiv and is indexed by them, anyway).

Beyond just the fun of looking at it, this tool can help uncover blind spots. Unlike, say ConnectedPapers, it lets you explore 'similar' research without formal connections between the papers.

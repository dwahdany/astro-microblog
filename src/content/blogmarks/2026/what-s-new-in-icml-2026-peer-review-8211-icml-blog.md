ICML published some new rules for their 2026 peer review. Most notable are measures to combat AI slop and other ways of peer review abuse. They also mandate participating in organization of the conference if you submit at least four papers. Also, they will provide “advanced reasoning” LLM feedback before the submission deadline for authors.

 It is clear that AI is causing stark changes in the research landscape. Right now it's focused on AI slop, peer-review abuse, and so on. But I believe this is only the beginning, and we will have to deal with the broader impact of AI upending research as it was before.

I took the code assessment for an Anthropic Fellowship. Without spoiling their whole new exercise, I'd give the advice to read _their advice_ carefully. They said

> You should be familiar with writing classes and methods, using lists, dictionaries, and sets, and using the standard Python functions for sorting, hashing, and binary search. It's beneficial to be familiar with the standard library modules bisect and collections.

The task was quite fun and relevant, I would say. I plugged their advice into Claude to come up with training exercises, which worked out great.

I did get stuck on one task for far too long because I got way too tripped up over a small test issue (it was not critical, but they immediately responded to an email about that, dug into my code, and confirmed the issue!). It would have been possible to skip that task (you can always go back) and do the last one without completing the prior one, so keeping track of time and being mindful of that skip option would be my other advice.

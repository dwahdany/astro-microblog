Since I like [repairing electronics](https://blog.wahdany.eu/2025/Dec/9/repairing-apple-watch/) I'm happy to have learned that iFixit now has an app that makes it even easier for people to get into it. It explains all the necessary basics and even comes with a multi-modal AI chatbot: You can share an image of your problem and it will help you diagnose and remedy the problem, all based on the extensive information that iFixit Guides have for countless devices.

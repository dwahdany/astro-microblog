If you want to [set up PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/astro) on your website, you usually have to install a package, add the imports, etc. Posthog has fully integrated an AI agent into their install process, so you invoke an AI agent _as the installation step_. ![](/images/SCR-20251205-rjtl.png)

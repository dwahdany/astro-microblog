I somehow missed this, but OpenAI stated on October 22nd that [they are no longer legally obliged to retain all outputs](https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/). The legal action by the New York Times [led to a court order that compelled them to do so](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-appeal-new-york-times-suit-demand-asking-not-delete-any-user-chats-2025-06-06/).
